### What's landed (in the WIP commit)

| File                                                                      | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Origin                                                                                                                     |

### Resume entry point (next session — what /workflow-work must do)

1. **Verify worker fix:**
   - `git diff workers/api/src/services/ingest.ts` — confirm the ~7-line change at lines 175-184 looks sane (matches D1 symmetry; comment explains why).
   - `git diff workers/api/test/events.route.test.ts` — review the +71 LOC; the new test must construct an idempotent replay and assert response has `missionsUpdated: []`. If an existing test was modified (e.g., one previously asserting `missionsUpdated: ['mis_...']` on a replay), confirm the update is correct.
   - Run gates: `pnpm --filter @questkit/worker-api test`, `pnpm --filter @questkit/worker-api typecheck`, `pnpm --filter @questkit/worker-api lint`. All must be GREEN.

2. **Finish demo fix:**
   - **First — recover the parked DemoToastHost edit:** `git stash list` (look for `workflow-exit: DemoToastHost half-done…`), then `git stash pop stash@{0}`. This restores the half-done error-variant refactor to the working tree.
   - `git diff apps/demo/src/components/DemoToastHost.tsx` — review the +68 LOC for the new error toast variant. Confirm the API the demo sub-agent designed is reasonable (probably extending `Reward | {kind:"error", ...}` or similar). Note: the file currently fails ESLint with `'toastLabel' is defined but never used` and `'ToastIcon' is defined but never used` because the refactor is mid-flight — wiring `useMissionClaim` to consume the new variant is what makes those vars "used."
   - **Wire `apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.ts:72-74`** — expand the catch block:
     ```ts
     } catch (err) {
       console.warn("[demo] claimMission failed", err);
       if (isQuestKitError(err) && (err.status === 409 || err.code === "claim_not_ready")) {
         showToast({ kind: "error", /* match the contract the agent built into DemoToastHost */ });
         if (onClaimed !== undefined) {
           try { await onClaimed(); } catch (e) { console.warn("[demo] post-409 refetch failed", e); }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     Import `QuestKitError` (or whatever the SDK exports) from `@questkit/core`. Pick the right error-detection predicate based on what `packages/core/src/client.ts` exports — likely `err instanceof QuestKitError && err.code === "claim_not_ready"`.
   - **Write `apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.test.tsx`** — Jest test that mocks `client.claimMission` to reject with `QuestKitError` (409 claim_not_ready), mocks `showToast` + `onClaimed`, asserts both were called.
   - Run gates: `pnpm --filter @questkit/demo test`, `…typecheck`, `…lint`.

3. **Converge gates from root:** `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` — all packages.

4. **Amend WIP commit** (or new commit on top):
   - The current WIP commit is named `WIP: workflow-exit during v0.1.9 hotfix …`. Either amend it with the additional changes, or land a NEW commit titled `v0.1.9 hotfix — F1 fix (KV replay symmetry + demo toast)`. Use the `git-commit` skill. **NO AI signature** per CLAUDE.md rule #7.

5. **Push + monitor CI:** `git push`, then `gh run watch` (or just `gh run list -L 5`). CI must turn green; deploy workflow must run; smoke test must pass. The E2E step may stay red — that's the still-unresolved TASK-005 manual gate (orthogonal to v0.1.9).

6. **Prod verify:**
   - `curl https://api.questkit.jairukchan.com/v1/health` — expect `{"ok":true,"version":"0.1.9","commit":"…"}`.
   - Reproduce F1: open `https://questkit.jairukchan.com` in a private window (fresh user — no carry-over), watch 3 documentaries, claim Curious Mind — must succeed cleanly (200 with reward, no 409). For an EXISTING multi-session user (the F1 trigger scenario), the new demo toast + refetch should now appear instead of silent failure.

7. **Archive Phase 9:** `/workflow-end` — moves work/\* into `instruction/archive/003-phase-9-v0.1.8-bug-fix-sweep/` (or rename to reflect 0.1.9 in the archive folder name). Resets work/ for Phase 10.

### Sub-agent IDs (stopped, do not resume — work was captured in the working tree)

- Worker fix agent: `a8d14cd71a40e3c27` — last reported action "Now run the new test to confirm GREEN, plus the full worker-api suite + typecheck + lint." (killed before this happened)
- Demo fix agent: `a989e2b1275da7081` — last reported action "Now update the toast rendering to use the new shape and apply error styling." (was mid-edit on DemoToastHost when killed; never reached useMissionClaim wiring)

### Phase 10 backlog (carried forward unchanged from earlier RESUME CONTEXT)

- Server-side minigame coin mint (B5 option b)
- BadgeWall persistence via `user_badges` table (badges granted outside mission flow)
- Replace `local-only` `binge_starter` celebration toast with a real server-side mission
- TASK-007 (D3) — reopen for defensive optimistic-counter pattern review (the v0.1.9 hotfix removes the trigger but the pattern itself still relies on `missionsUpdated` accuracy)

## RESUME CONTEXT — SUPERSEDED (kept for history)

> ⚠️ This earlier RESUME CONTEXT (13:30) is **superseded** by the newer
> "RESUME CONTEXT (v0.1.9 hotfix mid-flight)" block at the top of this
> file. The 13:30 block documents the state right after Phase 9 shipped
> v0.1.5–v0.1.8; the 14:05 block documents the v0.1.9 hotfix
> mid-flight state which is what the next session must resume from.
>
> Exit time: 2026-05-21 13:30
> Reason: User invoked /workflow-exit — session checkpoint
> Working tree: clean. All changes committed and pushed.

### Session outcome — Phase 9 v0.1.5 → v0.1.8 shipped

All 8 planned Phase 9 tasks complete. Three follow-up hotfixes
(v0.1.6 → v0.1.8) walked the B6 root-cause bisect to a verified fix.

| Version | Commit    | Status                                                                 |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| v0.1.5  | `7321670` | Phase 9 bug-fix sweep (B1/B3/B4/B5 + D1–D6 + CI gate code side)        |
| v0.1.6  | `1021905` | BadgeWall panel + Canvas2D opt-in + AI model swap (B6 step 1)          |
| v0.1.7  | `a8120d2` | response_format → json_schema (B6 step 2)                              |
| v0.1.8  | `bbe0a0f` | 4th envelope strategy `response-object` (B6 step 3 — VERIFIED WORKING) |

### Production state — 2026-05-21 13:30

- `https://api.questkit.jairukchan.com/v1/health` → `{"ok":true,"version":"0.1.8"}`
- `GET /v1/recommendations` → real LLM picks, no `fallback:true` field
- All v0.1.5 bug fixes shipped: claim flow, widget reconciliation, honest minigame
  toasts, footer version, Curious Mind audit, observability
- BadgeWall panel deployed (top-left FAB, code-split ~4kB)
- ScratchCard Canvas2D warning silenced

### Remaining manual items for user (no code work pending)

1. **Manual browser walkthrough at `https://questkit.jairukchan.com`** — re-test
   B1/B3/B4/B5 + verify BadgeWall + verify AI picks panel populates. Phase 9
   acceptance.
2. **Optional: unblock CI E2E gate** — `openssl rand -hex 32` → GH secret
   `CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN` + CF dashboard WAF rule per `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md` §8.6.
   Workers + bug fixes are already live; only the E2E badge stays red until
   these manual steps land.
3. **Phase 10 backlog** — already noted in CHANGELOG / test-report:
   - Server-side minigame coin mint (B5 option b — deferred per scope)
   - Potential BadgeWall persistence via a `user_badges` table if a future
     phase wants badges granted outside the mission flow
   - Replace `local-only` `binge_starter` celebration toast with a real
     server-side mission so it shows up in BadgeWall

### Agent States (all closed)

All 7 sub-agents from Wave 1 + Wave 2 completed and reported in. No background
processes or unfinished work. Working tree is clean — no stash, no WIP commit
needed.

### Resume entry point

If next session asks "มีงานค้างไหม":

- `instruction/work/` still has `plan.md`, `requirements.md`, `test-report.md`,
  `todos.md` for Phase 9. Either:
  - **Archive Phase 9** via `/workflow-end` — moves the work/ files to
    `instruction/archive/003-phase-9-v0.1.8-bug-fix-sweep/` and resets work/.
  - **Continue with manual walkthrough** + the optional CI gate steps before
    archiving.

### Task: [TASK-001] Cluster C1 — `mission.claimed` SSE event + refetch fallback

- **Status:** 🟢 done (awaiting downstream verification by TASK-002)
- **Priority:** P0
- **Parallel:** no (foundation — TASK-002 depends on this)
- **Assigned:** TASK-001 Agent
- **Depends on:** -
- **Skills:** -
- **Covers:** B1, D2
- **Files:**
  - `packages/types/src/sdk-update.ts`
  - `packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts`
  - `packages/react/test/hooks/useMissions.test.tsx`
  - `packages/react/test/components/MissionCard.test.tsx`
  - `workers/api/src/routes/missions.ts`
  - `workers/api/src/routes/missions.test.ts`
  - `apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.ts`
  - **+ added (scoped deviation):** `apps/demo/src/panels/EventLog.tsx` (exhaustive-switch update), `apps/demo/src/routes/streaming.tsx` + `apps/demo/src/routes/daily.tsx` (wire `onClaimed: useMissions().refetch`), `packages/react/src/components/MissionList/index.tsx` + `packages/react/test/components/MissionList.test.tsx` (wrap `onClaim` to self-refetch — required so ecommerce's MissionList-owned `useMissions` instance also benefits from the safety net)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] test: `useMissions.test.tsx` — `mission.claimed` handler flips status (red→green)
  - [x] test: `MissionCard.test.tsx` — `status === "claimed"` display contract pinned (passes against existing display logic)
  - [x] test: `missions.test.ts` integration — claim delivers 3 SSE events to a live subscriber + ordering pinned
  - [x] implement: add `mission.claimed` variant to `SDKUpdate` union
  - [x] implement: emit `mission.claimed` from `tryBroadcastClaim` (FIRST in the 3-event sequence)
  - [x] implement: handler in `useMissions` for `mission.claimed` (terminal overwrite branch)
  - [x] implement: refetch fallback in `useMissionClaim` (+ MissionList wrap for ecommerce)
  - [x] verify: tests green (208 worker-api + 151 react incl. new) + typecheck clean + lint clean
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 11:20 - Started — claiming file locks for the 7 task files
  - 11:45 - Complete. 3 new tests added (useMissions, MissionList refetch fallback, missions.test.ts SSE delivery). MissionCard test extended with explicit data-status+disabled+label assertion. Demo's EventLog switch updated (exhaustive). Deviation noted: MissionList scope was expanded so ecommerce route's MissionList-owned useMissions also benefits from the refetch fallback — without this, B1 would still regress on ecommerce when SSE drops. All checks green.

### Task: [TASK-002] Cluster C2 — demo widgets reconciled to server state

- **Status:** 🟢 done (typecheck + lint + Jest tests green; e2e listed (54 tests across 7 specs); local e2e runtime deferred to TASK-008 walkthrough — local APP_SECRET infra gap)
- **Priority:** P1
- **Parallel:** yes (after TASK-001)
- **Assigned:** TASK-002 Agent (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** TASK-001
- **Skills:** frontend-test
- **Covers:** B3, B4, D1
- **Files:**
  - `apps/demo/src/routes/streaming.tsx`
  - `apps/demo/src/routes/daily.tsx`
  - `apps/demo/e2e/claim-flow.spec.ts` (new — 3 tests × 2 projects = 6 listed entries)
  - `apps/demo/e2e/daily.spec.ts` (rewrite of streak-persistence test — server-state-backed)
  - `apps/demo/e2e/streaming.spec.ts` (regex tweak in "Logging…" test — accepts [1-3]/3 now that the counter mirrors the documentary mission)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] test: E2E `/streaming` Today's progress reconciles after claim without nav
  - [x] test: E2E `/daily` streak reconciles after claim without nav
  - [x] implement: derive `/streaming` widget from `useMissions()` (drop local `watchedToday`)
  - [x] implement: derive `/daily` streak hero from `useMissions()` (drop `localStorage`)
  - [x] implement: `Math.min(current, target)` clamp pattern consistent with MissionCard
  - [ ] verify: manual browser walkthrough — 5 watches + claim on each page, widget reconciles within 2s (deferred to TASK-008 release walkthrough — depends on full prod deploy)
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 2026-05-21 12:10 - Started. File locks claimed. Confirmed mission IDs from migrations 0002/0003: streaming widget will derive from `mis_stream_documentary_3` (count=3, the only 3-target streaming mission — "Curious Mind" badge — its filter is documentary-only, but it IS the canonical 3-target mission the widget was always meant to track). Daily widget will derive from `mis_daily_visitor` (count=1, daily, badge). `MissionProgress` shape has `status`, `currentCount`, `updatedAt` — no `lastIncrementedAt`, so daily claimedToday derivation = `status === "claimed"` OR (`updatedAt >= startOfDay(now)` AND `currentCount >= targetCount`).
  - 2026-05-21 12:30 - Implementation complete. streaming.tsx: dropped `watchedToday` useState, derived from `missionsState.data?.progress[mis_stream_documentary_3]` with `Math.min(currentCount, targetCount)` clamp. Binge Starter celebration uses `useRef` + `useEffect` that fires only on a strictly increasing transition INTO target during this session (guarded by `hasSeenInitialRef` so a reload with count already at 3 doesn't re-celebrate). daily.tsx: dropped STREAK_STORAGE_KEY + readStreak/writeStreak entirely. claimedToday derives from `progress.updatedAt` falling in today's UTC window AND currentCount > 0 (gated to avoid yesterday's "claimed" row triggering "Already checked in" on a fresh today visit — the evaluator resets the row on the first daily.login in a new window per workers/api/src/rules/evaluator.ts:99-125). streakCount = `claimedToday ? Math.min(currentCount, target) : 0`. Updated daily.spec.ts reload-persistence test to assert server MissionProgress round-trip (the persistence path the new code uses) instead of localStorage round-trip. Tweaked streaming.spec.ts regex from `^[1-9]\d*/3$` to `^[1-3]/3$` since the widget now mirrors the documentary mission's count and the 4-click run touches only 1 documentary. New claim-flow.spec.ts has 3 tests (ecommerce / streaming / daily) verifying the post-claim UI converges to status=claimed within 2s, widget reflects, no navigation. All verifications green: demo typecheck clean, demo lint clean, demo Jest 2/2 pass, Playwright `--list` shows 54 tests across 7 specs (3 new claim-flow tests visible on both chromium-desktop + mobile-chrome projects). Local Playwright runtime blocked by `apps/demo/.dev.vars` missing APP_SECRET (same infra gap TASK-005 documented + TASK-003 noted) — manual + CI E2E gates run in TASK-005's GitHub Actions workflow once the manual CF dashboard steps land.

### Task: [TASK-003] Cluster C3 — minigame toast honesty

- **Status:** 🟢 done (worker tests + typecheck + lint all green; local E2E blocked by missing APP_SECRET in .dev.vars — runs in CI via TASK-005)
- **Priority:** P1
- **Parallel:** yes
- **Assigned:** workflow-work (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** -
- **Skills:** frontend-test
- **Covers:** B5, D6
- **Files:**
  - `apps/demo/src/routes/minigames.tsx`
  - `apps/demo/e2e/minigames.spec.ts` (existing — extending)
  - `workers/api/test/events.route.test.ts` (extending — existing events test file)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] test: E2E spin toast contains no "coin" substring (new test `TASK-003: spin wheel toast + caption mention NO coin`)
  - [x] test: E2E scratch toast contains no "coin" substring (new test `TASK-003: scratch card toast + caption + prize render NO coin`)
  - [x] test: integration `qk.minigame.spin` event does NOT mutate balances (3 new tests under `TASK-003 minigame no-currency-mint contract` — all GREEN against real D1)
  - [x] implement: replace coin labels with badge text in `minigames.tsx`. All 6 wheel slices now use `{kind:"badge", badgeId:"lucky_spinner"}` with celebration labels; scratch onReveal now passes `{kind:"badge", badgeId:"scratch_master"}`; prize panel shows "Scratch Master" (was "+30 coin"); "Won:" caption is badge-themed; bullet footer honestly states "No currency is minted by these events"
  - [x] implement: distinguish currency vs badge toast in `useDemoToast` — NOT NEEDED. `DemoToastHost.rewardLabel` already had a `badge` branch since Phase 8 (`DemoToastHost.tsx:48-50` → "Badge: ${badgeId}") with the `BadgeIcon` rendering correctly
  - [x] verify: confirmed grep on `minigames.tsx` — no "coin" / "+N coin" / "+N gem" appears in any user-visible label or caption. Only "coin"/"currency" mentions remaining are in code comments documenting the contract (intentional)
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 11:05 - Started. Confirmed reward shapes: server-side `mis_lucky_spinner` and `mis_scratch_master` (migration 0004) both have `reward_json = {"kind":"badge",...}`. Worker only mints currency in `claimMission` (db/schema.ts:722) — `POST /v1/events` never writes to balances regardless of event name. DemoToastHost already supports `kind:"badge"` (DemoToastHost.tsx:48-50 → "Badge: ${badgeId}"). Existing E2E spec at `apps/demo/e2e/minigames.spec.ts` — extending. Worker tests live in `/test/` (not `/src/routes/`) per project convention — extending `events.route.test.ts` rather than creating a new file.
  - 11:25 - GREEN: 3 new worker integration tests pass against real D1 / rule engine — `qk.minigame.spin` does NOT touch `balances`, `qk.minigame.scratch` does NOT touch `balances`, completing `mis_lucky_spinner` (5 spins → 5/5) STILL leaves balances empty. Worker-api typecheck + lint clean. 20 existing events tests still pass (23 total). Demo typecheck has 1 unrelated error in EventLog.tsx (TASK-001's `mission.claimed` SDKUpdate variant) — NOT introduced by this task. Playwright spec compiles (12 tests across 2 browsers); local E2E run blocked by missing APP_SECRET in `apps/demo/.dev.vars` (existing infra gap; TASK-005's CI-bypass work covers the production gate). Manual walkthrough deferred to TASK-008 release gate per phase plan.

### Task: [TASK-004] Cluster C4 — footer version + Curious Mind audit

- **Status:** 🟢 done (test, typecheck, lint, build green; walkthrough deferred to TASK-008)
- **Priority:** P2
- **Parallel:** yes
- **Assigned:** TASK-004 Agent (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** -
- **Skills:** -
- **Covers:** D5, D4
- **Files:**
  - `apps/demo/src/components/Layout.tsx`
  - `apps/demo/src/components/Layout.test.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/demo/jest.config.cjs` (new — Jest scaffold for demo)
  - `apps/demo/test/setup.ts` (new — jest-dom matchers)
  - `apps/demo/package.json` (added test deps + script)
  - `apps/demo/tsconfig.json` (added jest types)
  - `workers/api/src/rules/evaluator.test.ts`
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] test: `Layout.test.tsx` — footer version matches `package.json` version (2 tests passing)
  - [x] test: `evaluator.test.ts` — Curious Mind matches only `genre === "documentary"` (4 regression tests passing)
  - [x] implement: wire `Layout.tsx:226` to read version from `package.json` (no `with` attribute; resolveJsonModule already on; bundle inlines value)
  - [x] implement: fix Curious Mind rule only if audit fails — **Audit verdict: PASS** (no code change needed; tests now lock the behaviour)
  - [ ] verify: walkthrough confirms footer reads `v0.1.5` after TASK-008 bump (deferred to TASK-008 release)
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 2026-05-21 11:25 - TASK-004 claimed by TASK-004 Agent. Files locked.
  - 2026-05-21 11:45 - Done. Footer wired via `import pkg from "../../../../package.json"` (4 levels up); Vite inlines `Ut="0.1.0"` in the bundle today, will inline `0.1.5` after TASK-008 bumps the root. Curious Mind audit: PASS — the eq+missing-field semantics in `filter.ts` already enforce documentary-only; 4 regression tests (match/non-match/missing-field/three-watch completion) now lock the behaviour. Scaffolded Jest in `apps/demo` (ts-jest + jsdom + jest-dom + identity-obj-proxy, mirroring `packages/react`). All verifications green: 207/207 worker-api tests, 2/2 demo tests, demo typecheck (except an unrelated TASK-001-in-flight `EventLog.tsx` error), demo build, demo lint.

### Task: [TASK-005] Cluster C5 — CI E2E gate via CF WAF rule + secret header (= old TASK-011)

- **Status:** 🟢 code-complete (awaiting manual CF dashboard + GH secret steps)
- **Priority:** P1
- **Parallel:** yes
- **Assigned:** Main Agent (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** -
- **Skills:** cloudflare-naming, deploy, env-sync
- **Covers:** TASK-011 carry-over from Phase 8
- **Files:**
  - `apps/demo/playwright.config.ts`
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`
  - `.env.example` (N/A — no root `.env.example` in repo; token is Playwright-only, never reaches workers, so no `.dev.vars.example` entry needed either)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [ ] manual (user): `openssl rand -hex 32` → store as GH secret `CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN`
  - [ ] manual (user): create CF WAF custom rule (zone `jairukchan.com`) scoped to POST /api/token + `x-questkit-ci-bypass` header → Skip SBFM + Managed Rules (see SELF_HOSTING.md §8.6 for exact expression)
  - [x] implement: `playwright.config.ts` extraHTTPHeaders gated to prod target
  - [x] implement: workflow passes `CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN` to E2E step
  - [x] docs: `SELF_HOSTING.md` "CI E2E bypass" subsection (§8.6)
  - [x] env-sync: confirmed N/A — Playwright reads from process.env only; no .env.example file exists in repo root; .dev.vars.example files target wrangler workers which never see this token
  - [ ] verify: `gh workflow run deploy.yml` → E2E step green (BLOCKED on manual steps above)
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 11:15 - Started code-side implementation
  - 11:30 - Code complete: playwright.config.ts extraHTTPHeaders gated on `target === "prod" && process.env.CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN`; deploy.yml E2E step now receives `CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN }}`; SELF_HOSTING.md §8.6 documents the full bypass flow including exact WAF rule expression, rotation procedure, and security trade-off analysis. `@questkit/demo` typecheck clean. Playwright config loads OK with env vars set (verified via `playwright test --list`). Without the manual GH secret + CF rule steps, CI E2E will still fail (expected — code side is ready; manual side is the remaining gate).

### Task: [TASK-006] B6 investigation spike — AI picks fallback rate

- **Status:** 🔴 closed — ESCALATED to Phase 10 backlog (verdict: P0 prod bug)
- **Priority:** P2 (verification-only) → P0 follow-up
- **Parallel:** yes
- **Assigned:** task-006-agent (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** -
- **Skills:** -
- **Covers:** B6
- **Files:**
  - `workers/api/src/services/ai.ts` (observability — distinct reason per fallback branch + fingerprint)
  - `instruction/work/test-report.md` (verdict)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] verify: `curl /v1/recommendations` × 5 against prod with seed user — count `fallback: true` → **5/5 = 100%**
  - [x] implement: distinct `console.warn` per fallback branch at `ai.ts` (envelope strategy + fingerprint + ai-run-threw)
  - [x] decide: rate ≥ 80% → **ESCALATE P0, added to Phase 10 backlog**
  - [x] verify: outcome decision written into `instruction/work/test-report.md` "TASK-006 — B6 verification spike" section
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 11:25 - Spike started. Confirmed: ai.ts:307 already has `console.warn("[ai] response did not match any known envelope; falling back")`. Route at recommendations.ts:146 has a second `console.warn("[recommendations] ai binding failure, falling back", err)` for the `env.AI.run()` throw branch. Need to add distinct reasons per envelope strategy that fails and a fingerprint of the raw response when none match.
  - 11:50 - Curl × 5 against prod with 5 fresh user IDs → **5/5 fallback rate (100%)**. Above 80% escalate threshold. Verdict: ESCALATE — this is a real P0 bug, not the Phase 8 fallback "working as designed". Underlying cause unknown (likely model-id deprecation per amendment A8, or new envelope shape, or `response_format` regression). Observability instrumentation landed: `normalizeAiEnvelope` now returns `EnvelopeOutcome{strategy, fingerprint}` (value-stripped to avoid PII/prompt-injection leak), `recommendMissions` wraps `env.AI.run` in try/catch with `[ai] fallback reason=ai-run-threw …` log. All 12 existing `ai.service.test.ts` tests still green; typecheck + lint clean. Next deploy needs `wrangler tail` window so operator can identify which branch fires. Full Phase 10 backlog entry + diagnostic recipe in test-report.md.

### Task: [TASK-007] Cluster C6 — optimistic counter debounce (D3)

- **Status:** 🟢 closed (non-bug)
- **Priority:** P2
- **Parallel:** yes
- **Assigned:** TASK-007 Agent
- **Depends on:** -
- **Skills:** -
- **Covers:** D3
- **Files:**
  - ~~`packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts`~~ (no change needed — see verdict)
  - `packages/react/test/hooks/useMissions.test.tsx` (regression test added)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] test: non-qualifying `mission.progress` event does NOT bump optimistic counter — added under `describe("optimistic updates from fireEvent (no SSE)")`, green
  - [x] implement: ~~1.5s debounce~~ — **not required.** Verdict below.
  - [x] verify: contract pinned by the new regression test; 5-buy mixed-category manual walkthrough deferred to TASK-002 walkthrough (still in plan)
- **Verdict (D3 is a non-bug):**
  - Server-side rule engine (`workers/api/src/rules/index.ts :: evaluateEvent`) only returns missions whose `evaluate()` returned `matched: true` (event name + filter + window + expiry all pass).
  - `/v1/events` route forwards `updated.map(p => p.missionId)` as `missionsUpdated`.
  - SDK (`packages/core/src/client.ts :: buildSendFn`, line 407) passes that server-filtered array straight to `onFireEventSuccess` listeners — no local fan-out.
  - Hook's existing for-loop in `useMissions.ts:143` only bumps IDs explicitly listed → non-qualifying missions are structurally unreachable. No debounce timer required.
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 11:35 - Read `useMissions.ts:130-178`, `client.ts:313-428`, `routes/events.ts`, `services/ingest.ts:260-268`, `rules/index.ts`, `rules/evaluator.ts`. Confirmed server-filter chain. D3 is structurally impossible. Added regression test (1 new test, passes against current source). No source edit needed → no Phase B file lock on `useMissions.ts` required. Closing as non-bug. NB: pre-existing `mission.claimed` test fails — that's TASK-001's outstanding handler work, not mine.

### Task: [TASK-008] v0.1.5 release — version bump + smoke + walkthrough

- **Status:** 🟢 DEPLOYED to prod — v0.1.5 live on `https://api.questkit.jairukchan.com` (`/v1/health` confirms `version:"0.1.5"`). Awaits user manual walkthrough + optional E2E gate unblock.
- **Priority:** P0
- **Parallel:** no (last)
- **Assigned:** Main Agent (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-005, TASK-007 (all done); TASK-006 closed as ESCALATE
- **Skills:** deploy, frontend-test, git-commit, git-push
- **Covers:** release gate for v0.1.5
- **Files:**
  - `package.json` (0.1.0 → 0.1.5)
  - `workers/api/src/index.ts` (/v1/health version 0.1.4 → 0.1.5)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (added 0.1.5 + 0.1.4 entries — 0.1.4 was missing)
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] implement: bump root `package.json` to `0.1.5`
  - [x] implement: bump `/v1/health` static version in `workers/api/src/index.ts` to `0.1.5`
  - [x] implement: append Phase 9 entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (also added missing Phase 8 entry for traceability)
  - [x] verify: full `pnpm typecheck` clean (14/14 tasks)
  - [x] verify: full `pnpm lint` clean (10/10 tasks)
  - [x] verify: full `pnpm test` clean (208 worker-api + 150 react + 2 demo = 360 tests, 1 pre-existing skip)
  - [x] verify: `pnpm --filter @questkit/demo build` succeeds; built bundle contains `0.1.5` (footer wiring confirmed)
  - [x] commit & push to `main` (commit `7321670`, push 12:35 — CI run `26204334507` in flight)
  - [ ] **manual (user, post-deploy):** verify `https://api.questkit.jairukchan.com/v1/health` returns `version:"0.1.5"`
  - [ ] **manual (user, post-deploy):** verify footer at `https://questkit.jairukchan.com/` reads `v0.1.5`
  - [ ] **manual (user, post-deploy):** walkthrough — re-test B1 (/ecommerce claim → coin credits + counter decrements), B3 (/streaming claim → widget reconciles), B4 (/daily claim → streak persists), B5 (/minigames → no "coin" toasts)
  - [ ] **manual (user, optional for E2E gate):** complete TASK-005 dashboard steps: 1. `openssl rand -hex 32` → GH secret `CI_BOT_BYPASS_TOKEN` 2. CF dashboard → WAF custom rule (full expression in `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md` §8.6) — without these the E2E step stays red but workers still deploy + bug fixes still land
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 10:15 - Task created
  - 12:00 - Code-side complete. Version bumps + CHANGELOG done. All test suites green. Build artifact contains `0.1.5`.
  - 12:35 - Committed `7321670`, pushed to `main`. CI run `26204334507` in flight; deploy workflow triggers on CI success.
  - 13:00 - CI `26204334507` → SUCCESS (3m47s). Deploy `26204447641` ran:
    ✅ D1 migrations applied, all 6 workers deployed (api/consumer/relay/demo/docs/playground), smoke-test green
    ❌ "Run E2E suite against live deploy" failed — EXPECTED: CF WAF rule + GH secret not yet wired (TASK-005 manual sub-steps).
    **Production verification:** `curl https://api.questkit.jairukchan.com/v1/health` returns `{"ok":true,"version":"0.1.5","commit":"dev"}` — v0.1.5 IS LIVE.
    Bug fixes B1/B3/B4/B5 + D1–D6 all shipped. B6 escalated to Phase 10. Walkthrough belongs to user (real browser + DevTools).

### Task: [TASK-009] Frontend automated walkthrough — prod v0.1.8 verification

- **Status:** 🟢 done (PASS with one Phase-10 finding — see F1 below)
- **Priority:** P0 (Phase 9 acceptance gate)
- **Parallel:** no (single browser session)
- **Assigned:** Main Agent (Opus 4.7) via frontend-test skill + Playwright MCP
- **Depends on:** TASK-001 → TASK-008 (all done)
- **Skills:** frontend-test
- **Covers:** manual walkthrough checkboxes on TASK-002 + TASK-008
- **Environment:** production — `https://questkit.jairukchan.com` + `https://api.questkit.jairukchan.com`
- **Files:**
  - `instruction/work/test-report.md` (TASK-009 section appended — see for full evidence)
  - `agent-temp/phase9-01-landing.png` … `phase9-06-minigames-ai-picks-panel.png`
- **Scenarios:**
  - [x] S1: footer reads `v0.1.8` ✅
  - [x] S2: B1 `/ecommerce` claim → balance 0→100 + card flipped + 3 SSE events ✅
  - [x] S3: B3 `/streaming` widget reconciles with mission (lockstep across 4 events incl. drama filter) ✅
  - [x] S4: B4 `/daily` streak persists after full reload (0 localStorage streak keys) ✅
  - [x] S5: B5 `/minigames` spin toast "You won: Bonus tick!" + zero "coin"/"gem" in main + balance unchanged ✅
  - [x] S6: BadgeWall FAB opens "Earned badges" panel; shows Daily Visitor ✅
  - [x] S7: AI picks populated with personalized LLM intro + 2 real picks ✅
  - [x] S8: console clean except F1 (no CSP/CORS/404/hydration/React noise) ⚠️ → F1 logged
- **New finding (logged for Phase 10):**
  - **F1:** Silent `claim_not_ready` (409) on apparent-3/3 Curious Mind claim. Server-authoritative state was 2/3 (visible in AI picks panel) while `/streaming` mirror was 3/3 (optimistic counter overshoot in multi-session resume). Demo swallows the 409 with `console.warn` only — no user-visible feedback. P2, adjacent to TASK-007 (D3 "non-bug" verdict should be reopened). Fix candidates: demo toast + refetch on 409, or worker-side error code split. **NOT a Phase 9 regression** — B1/B3/B4/B5/B6 all verified.
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 2026-05-21 13:45 - Task created. Playwright MCP tools loaded. agent-temp ready. Starting at `/ecommerce`.
  - 2026-05-21 13:55 - Walkthrough complete. 8/8 PASS (S8 has F1 noise — separately logged). Full evidence in test-report.md "TASK-009" section. Phase 9 acceptance: PASS. Awaits user disposition on F1 (defer to Phase 10 vs. hotfix as v0.1.9).

### Task: [TASK-010] v0.1.9 hotfix — F1 fix (KV replay symmetry + demo toast for silent 409)

- **Status:** 🔵 in-progress (resuming from RESUME CONTEXT 2026-05-21 14:05)
- **Priority:** P0 (Phase 9 hotfix, blocks acceptance close-out)
- **Parallel:** yes (W + D streams independent, touch different packages)
- **Assigned:** Lead (Opus 4.7) + sub-agents W + D
- **Depends on:** TASK-009 (✅ done — F1 finding)
- **Skills:** git-commit, git-push, deploy, frontend-test
- **Covers:** F1 — silent `claim_not_ready` (409) on apparent-3/3 Curious Mind claim
- **Root cause:** Asymmetric idempotency replays — D1 UNIQUE-collision branch returned `missionsUpdated:[]`, but KV `getOrSet` replay branch returned the original mission IDs. Retried event "succeeded" with stale mission updates that no longer reflected server state → demo optimistic counter overshot → silent 409 on claim.
- **Files (already in WIP commit `18b0972`):**
  - `workers/api/src/services/ingest.ts:175-184` — KV replay returns `missionsUpdated:[]` (symmetry with D1 branch)
  - `workers/api/test/events.route.test.ts` (+71 LOC) — regression test for KV-replay symmetry
  - `package.json` 0.1.8 → 0.1.9
  - `workers/api/src/index.ts` `/v1/health` version → 0.1.9
  - `CHANGELOG.md` v0.1.9 entry
  - `instruction/work/test-report.md` TASK-009 walkthrough section
- **Files (pending — demo sub-agent D):**
  - `apps/demo/src/components/DemoToastHost.tsx` (PARKED IN stash@{0} — half-done error-variant refactor, +68 LOC, needs `git stash pop`)
  - `apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.ts:72-74` — wire catch block to detect `QuestKitError` 409/claim_not_ready, surface toast + refetch
  - `apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.test.tsx` (NEW — Jest spec asserting toast + onClaimed both called on 409)
- **Sub-agent assignments:**
  - **W (Worker Verifier, Opus 4.7):** Verify ingest.ts + events.route.test.ts diff sanity, run `pnpm --filter @questkit/worker-api test/typecheck/lint`, report all-green or failure list. NO new file edits.
  - **D (Demo Fix Finisher, Opus 4.7):** Pop stash, complete useMissionClaim wiring + write Jest test, run `pnpm --filter @questkit/demo test/typecheck/lint`. Files locked under TASK-010 below.
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] WIP commit landed (`18b0972`) with worker fix + version bumps + docs
  - [x] verify (W): worker-api gates GREEN against landed diffs (test 209/0/1 skip, typecheck clean, lint clean modulo pre-existing Node ESM warning)
  - [x] implement (D): pop stash + wire useMissionClaim + write test
  - [x] verify (D): demo gates GREEN
  - [x] verify (Lead): root gates `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` — 14/14 typecheck, 10/10 lint, 500+ tests (worker-api 209/0/1-skip, react 150/0, core 116/0, demo 4/0, embed 21/0, webhook-relay 3 suites, webhook-consumer 1 suite) — ALL GREEN
  - [ ] commit (Lead): NEW commit on top of WIP — "v0.1.9 hotfix — F1 fix (KV replay symmetry + demo toast)" via git-commit skill, NO AI signature
  - [ ] push + monitor (Lead): git-push skill, CI green, deploy green, smoke green (E2E may stay red — TASK-005 manual gate)
  - [ ] prod verify (Lead): `/v1/health` shows 0.1.9; Playwright fresh-user F1 reproduction (must succeed, no 409); existing-user scenario deferred to user manual
  - [ ] archive (Lead): `/workflow-end` after user confirmation — moves work/ to `instruction/archive/003-phase-9-v0.1.9-bug-fix-sweep/`
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 2026-05-21 14:05 - WIP commit landed during workflow-exit (per RESUME CONTEXT above). Sub-agents stopped mid-task.
  - 2026-05-22 06:29 - Resuming. Working tree clean, WIP at HEAD (1 ahead of origin), stash@{0} confirmed. Sub-agents W + D dispatched in parallel.
  - 2026-05-22 06:30 - Sub-agent W reports ALL GREEN: diff sanity PASS (ingest.ts +6/-1 KV replay symmetry with D1 comment; events.route.test.ts +71 LOC new test primes 2 events → 3rd → idempotent replay asserts missionsUpdated:[] and replay header=hit). Tests 209/0/1-skip in 11.6s. Typecheck clean. Lint clean (one pre-existing MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON Node warning unrelated to hotfix). Worker side verified. Awaiting sub-agent D.
  - 2026-05-22 06:50 - Sub-agent D complete: stash recovered (cherry-picked only DemoToastHost.tsx — other stash files identical to HEAD or out of D's scope; stash@{0} left for Lead to drop). Finished DemoToastHost render-block wiring (item.reward→item.input, RewardIcon/rewardLabel→ToastIcon/toastLabel, error-variant container styling + description sub-line). Wired useMissionClaim.ts:72 catch block: `err instanceof QuestKitError && (status===409 || code==='claim_not_ready')` → showToast({kind:'error',title,description}) + await onClaimed (failures swallowed). NEW test apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.test.tsx: 2 specs (409→toast+refetch, 500→neither). Demo gates: test 4/4 in 2 suites, typecheck clean, lint clean. Locks released.

### Task: [TASK-011] v0.1.10 hotfix — per-browser demo user (shared-user defect)

- **Status:** 🔵 in-progress (sub-agent V dispatched 2026-05-22 07:35)
- **Priority:** P0 (Phase 9 acceptance gate — without this, all prod F1-style verification is unreliable)
- **Parallel:** no (single sub-agent + lead release pipeline)
- **Assigned:** Lead (Opus 4.7) + sub-agent V (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** TASK-010 (v0.1.9 shipped)
- **Skills:** git-commit, git-push, deploy, frontend-test
- **Covers:** F2 — all browser visitors share `demo_user_42`, causing race conditions, intermittent badge grants, "click N times nothing happens" once a mission hits cap
- **Root cause:** `apps/demo/src/lib/client.tsx:36-40` `resolveDemoUserId()` defaults to hardcoded `"demo_user_42"` for every visitor without a `?user=` query param. Multiple concurrent browsers all operate as the same user; SSE delivers cross-visitor events; server-side idempotency / replay / completion-cap masks subsequent visitors' clicks.
- **Evidence (from Playwright session + user manual report):**
  - POST `/v1/events` body always `userId:"demo_user_42"`
  - Mission Curious Mind jumped 0→2/3 on a single click (someone else clicked between snapshots)
  - User report: 0/3 → 1/3 → 2/3 then 6 more clicks with no progress change (mission completed, no further increments)
  - Event log delivers events not initiated by the local browser (cross-visitor SSE leak)
- **Files (sub-agent V):**
  - `apps/demo/src/lib/client.tsx` — `resolveDemoUserId()` rewrite
  - `apps/demo/src/lib/client.test.tsx` (NEW) — Jest spec covering LS hit / LS miss → fresh mint + LS write / `?user=` override / SSR fallback / localStorage-disabled fallback
  - `package.json` 0.1.9 → 0.1.10
  - `workers/api/src/index.ts` `/v1/health` version → 0.1.10
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — prepend v0.1.10 entry
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] implement (V): per-browser UUID via localStorage, ?user= override preserved
  - [x] test (V): Jest spec for resolveDemoUserId 4 cases
  - [x] bump (V): version 0.1.9 → 0.1.10 in package.json, health route, CHANGELOG
  - [x] verify (V): demo gates `pnpm --filter @questkit/demo test/typecheck/lint` all GREEN
  - [x] verify (Lead): root gates GREEN (14/14 typecheck, 10/10 lint, 500+ tests; worker-api 209/0/1-skip, demo 8/0 incl. 4 new client.test.tsx)
  - [x] commit (Lead): `accb96c v0.1.10 hotfix — F2 fix (per-browser demo user via localStorage)` — no AI signature
  - [x] push + monitor (Lead): CI `26261410400` GREEN 3m31s; Deploy `26261520602` workers + smoke GREEN, E2E red (expected — TASK-005 manual gate)
  - [x] prod verify (Lead): `/v1/health` → `{"ok":true,"version":"0.1.10"}`; Playwright fresh session: `localStorage.questkit_demo_user_id="demo_55a90ed7"` (not shared `demo_user_42`), footer v0.1.10, 2 doc clicks → server 2/3 + display 3/3 (F3 double-bump), claim → 409 → display reverts 3/3→2/3 (v0.1.9 catch + refetch verified end-to-end); 3rd click → server 3/3, claim → 200, BadgeWall 0→1, status=claimed. Screenshot: `agent-temp/v0.1.10-verify-curious-mind-claimed.png`
  - [ ] archive (Lead): `/workflow-end` after user confirmation on F3 disposition (v0.1.11 vs Phase 10 backlog)
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 2026-05-22 07:35 - TASK-011 created. Sub-agent V dispatching.
  - 2026-05-22 07:42 - Sub-agent V complete. Option A: extracted `resolveDemoUserId` → `demoUserId.ts` pure module, re-exported from `client.tsx`. 4 Jest cases (LS hit / LS miss + mint + write / `?user=` override / LS throws fallback). Version bumps + CHANGELOG. Demo gates GREEN (8 tests).
  - 2026-05-22 07:48 - Root gates GREEN. Committed `accb96c`. Pushed.
  - 2026-05-22 07:53 - CI GREEN. Deploy: workers + smoke GREEN, E2E red (expected). `/v1/health` = 0.1.10 confirmed.
  - 2026-05-22 07:55 - Playwright re-verify on prod: per-browser user `demo_55a90ed7` ✅, F1 silent failure FIXED (v0.1.9 toast + refetch live-verified end-to-end against reproducible 409), F2 shared-user FIXED (v0.1.10). **F3 (display double-bump in useMissions.ts) discovered as new finding** — see F3 section below.

### F3 finding (display double-bump in useMissions.ts — needs separate hotfix)

**Files / lines:**

- `packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts:94-143` (SSE handler, monotonic via `Math.max`)
- `packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts:149-193` (optimistic `onFireEventSuccess`, `+1` from existing)

**Root cause:** both update paths run on every event. SSE updates `currentCount = Math.max(existing, p.currentCount)` (monotonic but additive-compatible), then optimistic adds `+1` from the now-updated state. Net result: every event increments display by 2 while server only counts +1. Eventually display hits target before server does → claim returns 409 → v0.1.9 recovery path fires (toast + refetch).

**Hard evidence (from this Playwright session):**

- 1st click on Planet Earth III (fresh user `demo_55a90ed7`, server starts at 0): POST `/v1/events` body = ONE event (videoId v_doc_planet, genre documentary, duration_sec 3300). Response: `missionsUpdated:[mis_stream_daily_watch_1, mis_stream_documentary_3]`. After: Daily Watcher 1/1 (correct +1), Curious Mind 2/3 (incorrect +2).
- Server rule for `mis_stream_documentary_3`: `{"eventName":"video.watched","count":3,"window":"lifetime","filter":{"genre":{"eq":"documentary"}}}` — no count_field, no duration scaling. Should be flat +1 per matched event.
- 2nd click (Blue Worlds): server 1→2, display 2→3 (capped from 4). Claim → POST `/v1/missions/mis_stream_documentary_3/claim` → HTTP 409 `claim_not_ready`. Console: `[demo] claimMission failed QuestKitError: claim_not_ready`. Display reverted 3/3 → 2/3 (v0.1.9 refetch). Claim button disappeared (no longer claimable).
- 3rd click (Blue Worlds): server 2→3, display 2→3 (no overshoot at cap). Claim → 200, badge granted, BadgeWall 0→1.

**TASK-007's "non-bug" verdict was wrong:** it analyzed SDK filtering ("hook only bumps IDs server confirmed") but missed the double-count when both SSE and optimistic deliver for the same event.

**Fix options for v0.1.11:**

- **A (simplest):** drop optimistic increment entirely, rely on SSE. Minor UX delay (~50-200ms) before counter reflects.
- **B (preserves UX):** correlate `eventId` between POST response and SSE delivery so optimistic skips if SSE already delivered for that eventId.
- **C (cleanest API):** change `/v1/events` response to include new `currentCount` per mission; hook applies authoritative count, no need for `+1` optimistic. Requires SDK type bump.

**Why it's tolerable today:** v0.1.9 demo error toast + refetch makes the resulting 409 RECOVERABLE rather than silent. Users see "Not ready yet" and the display corrects via refetch. UX is degraded but not broken.

- 2026-05-22 07:50 - Sub-agent V complete: Option A chosen — extracted `resolveDemoUserId` to new pure module `apps/demo/src/lib/demoUserId.ts` (75 LOC + JSDoc explaining precedence + private-mode fallback); `client.tsx` re-imports + re-exports. New Jest spec `apps/demo/src/lib/client.test.tsx` has 4 cases (LS hit / cold-mint+write / `?user=` override beats LS / LS throws → per-tab unique). Version bumps applied: root `package.json` 0.1.9 → 0.1.10, `/v1/health` 0.1.9 → 0.1.10, CHANGELOG prepended with full v0.1.10 entry (root cause / fix / why / files / notes). Demo gates all GREEN: test 8/8 across 3 suites (4 new + 4 pre-existing), typecheck clean, lint clean (modulo pre-existing MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON Node warning unrelated to hotfix). Locks released below.

### Task: [TASK-012] v0.1.11 hotfix — F3 fix (drop optimistic) + browser logging

- **Status:** 🔵 in-progress (sub-agent F dispatched 2026-05-22 08:00)
- **Priority:** P0 (Phase 9 acceptance gate — without this, F3 still causes 409s even if user-recoverable)
- **Parallel:** no (single sub-agent + lead release pipeline)
- **Assigned:** Lead (Opus 4.7) + sub-agent F (Opus 4.7)
- **Depends on:** TASK-011 (v0.1.10 shipped)
- **Skills:** git-commit, git-push, deploy
- **Covers:** F3 — `packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts` double-bump (SSE handler L94-143 + optimistic handler L149-193 both bump per event, display ends +2 from a +1 event)
- **Root cause:** SSE updates `Math.max(existing, p.currentCount)` (monotonic), then optimistic adds `+1 from existing`. When both fire for same event (the normal happy case), display gets +2 while server counts +1. Eventually display reaches target before server → claim returns 409.
- **Fix chosen (Option A):** drop optimistic path entirely, SSE is sole source of truth. Trade-off: ~50-200ms delay before counter updates (was instant via optimistic). Acceptable since SSE is typically fast and `useMissionClaim`'s refetch fallback (TASK-001) catches drops on the critical claim path.
- **Files (sub-agent F):**
  - `packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts` — remove L149-193 optimistic useEffect, update docblock, add console.debug at SSE handler
  - `packages/react/test/hooks/useMissions.test.tsx` — update/remove existing optimistic tests, add F3 regression "1 fireEvent = +1 progress, not +2"
  - `apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.ts` — add `console.debug("[demo:claim] success", …)` on the success path
  - `package.json` 0.1.10 → 0.1.11
  - `workers/api/src/index.ts` /v1/health → 0.1.11
  - `CHANGELOG.md` — prepend v0.1.11 entry
- **Subtasks:**
  - [x] implement (F): drop optimistic + add console.debug logging
  - [x] test (F): update existing optimistic tests + add F3 regression
  - [x] bump (F): version 0.1.10 → 0.1.11 + CHANGELOG
  - [x] verify (F): react + demo gates GREEN
  - [ ] verify (Lead): root gates
  - [ ] commit (Lead): "v0.1.11 hotfix — F3 fix (drop optimistic counter) + browser logging" via git-commit skill
  - [ ] push + monitor (Lead): CI + Deploy
  - [ ] prod verify (Lead): `/v1/health` 0.1.11; Playwright fresh user, 3 doc clicks → server 3/3 AND display 3/3 (no overshoot); claim 200 + badge; verify console.debug visible in DevTools verbose
  - [ ] archive (Lead): `/workflow-end` after user confirmation
- **Progress Notes:**
  - 2026-05-22 08:00 - TASK-012 created. Sub-agent F dispatching.
  - 2026-05-22 08:18 - Sub-agent F complete: optimistic +1 removed (deleted `useMissions.ts` L149-193 useEffect + the leading TASK-006 comment block; docblock rewritten to explain SSE-as-sole-source and the trade-off). `console.debug` added at SSE update (`packages/react/src/hooks/useMissions.ts:133`) + claim success (`apps/demo/src/lib/useMissionClaim.ts:69`), guarded with `typeof console !== "undefined" && console.debug !== undefined` for SSR / older runtimes. Optimistic-updates describe block replaced with `f3 regression — no double-bump from optimistic + SSE`: 4 tests (F3 +1-not-+2 pin / fireEvent-without-SSE-noop / console.debug shape spy / monotonic-merge regression preserved for out-of-order SSE). Version bumps applied (root package.json 0.1.10→0.1.11, /v1/health 0.1.10→0.1.11). CHANGELOG v0.1.11 entry prepended with root cause / fix / UX trade-off / observability / validation / files / cross-ref. React gates: test 16 suites/145 tests, typecheck clean, lint clean (modulo pre-existing MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON Node warning). Demo gates: test 3 suites/8 tests, typecheck clean, lint clean. Locks released below.
