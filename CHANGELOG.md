# Changelog

All notable changes to QuestKit are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-20

Polish release driven by the post-launch `/frontend-test` PDCA sweep.
Zero functional changes from v0.1.0; only console-hygiene and visual-
consistency fixes.

### Fixed

- **`GET /v1/balance/:currency` now returns 200 + zero-state** instead of
  404 when the user has no row for the requested currency. The 404
  generated noisy "Failed to load resource" entries in every demo
  consumer's console even though the SDK already rendered both states
  as "0". `@questkit/core` `getBalance()` return type tightened from
  `Balance | null` to `Balance`.
- **JWT signature-tamper test flake** — flip the FIRST char of the
  base64url signature (fully-used 6-bit position) instead of the LAST
  (only 4 meaningful + 4 unused bits). CI failed intermittently when
  the unlucky last-char flip only touched unused bits.

### Changed

- **`🪙` / `🏆` / `🎁` reward emojis replaced with inline SVG icons**
  (`apps/demo/src/components/icons.tsx`). Emoji glyphs render
  inconsistently across OS font stacks — Windows shows a grayscale
  pixelated U+1FA99 while macOS/iOS shows the gold coin you'd expect.
  SVG ensures the same brand impression everywhere. Used in both the
  header coin balance pill and the reward toast.

### Test report

See [`instruction/work/test-report.md`](instruction/work/test-report.md)
for the full PDCA log: 4 routes × console hygiene = 0 errors / 0
warnings, 5/5 Playwright golden-path E2E green vs production, 441
unit/integration tests across 6 packages.

[0.1.1]: https://github.com/ilGentEAcutoO/QuestKit/releases/tag/v0.1.1

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

First public release. Six-day, six-phase build of an embeddable
Cloudflare-native gamification SDK — React component library, vanilla
JS embed, REST + SSE API, webhook ingestion pipeline, Workers-AI
recommendations — with a live demo at https://questkit.jairukchan.com.

### Added

#### Packages (4 publishable)

- `@questkit/types` — strict TypeScript types for events, missions,
  rewards, balances, campaigns, and the SDKUpdate discriminated union.
- `@questkit/core` — framework-neutral SDK: `QuestKitClient`, rule
  engine (`daily`/`weekly`/`lifetime` windows + filter clauses), event
  queue with retry, SSE client with reconnect + polling fallback, idem-
  potency. 87 Jest tests.
- `@questkit/react` — React component library (peer-dep `^18.3 || ^19`):
  `QuestKitProvider`, hooks (`useMissions`, `useMission`, `useBalance`,
  `useEvent`, `useCampaign`, `useRecommendations`), components
  (`MissionList`, `MissionCard` with `iconUrl` render, `CoinBalance`,
  `CampaignBanner`, `RewardClaimToast`, `ProgressBar`,
  `RecommendedMissions`), and mini-games (`SpinWheel`, `ScratchCard`).
  125 RTL tests.
- `@questkit/embed` — vanilla `<script>` IIFE bundle (~59 KB gz),
  Shadow-DOM isolated, mounts on `data-questkit` attribute, re-mounts
  on `qk:reinit` events for SPA hosts. 21 tests.

#### Workers (6 deployed)

- `questkit-worker-api` — Hono REST + SSE on
  `api.questkit.jairukchan.com`. Bindings: D1 (truth), KV (idempotency
  - JWT denylist), R2 (assets), Durable Objects (`RateLimiter` SQLite
    sliding-window + `SSEHub` ReadableStream fanout), Queue (producer),
    Analytics Engine, Workers AI
    (`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast`). 165 vitest tests via
    `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.
- `questkit-worker-webhook-relay` — Stripe-style HMAC verification +
  Cloudflare Queue producer at `webhook.questkit.jairukchan.com`.
- `questkit-worker-webhook-consumer` — Queue consumer that invokes the
  api via `WorkerEntrypoint` RPC (typed, zero-serialization). DLQ with
  `max_retries: 5`, exponential backoff.
- `questkit-worker-demo` — Vite SPA at `questkit.jairukchan.com` with
  4 scenarios (e-commerce, streaming, daily, mini-games), 3 floating
  panels (DevTools, AIRecommendations, EventLog), inline /api/token
  proxy. All 5 routes meet Lighthouse mobile gates ≥ 0.92 perf, 1.00
  a11y, 1.00 best-practices.
- `questkit-worker-docs` — Docusaurus 3.10.1 SSG at
  `docs.questkit.jairukchan.com`. 36 routes. Tailwind v4 via custom
  PostCSS plugin.
- `questkit-worker-play` — vanilla-embed playground at
  `play.questkit.jairukchan.com` (plain HTML / WordPress mock /
  iframe).

#### Documentation

- 31-page Docusaurus site (concepts, react, embed, api, webhooks, faq,
  theming, self-hosting).
- 6 ADRs (`docs/decisions/`): Cloudflare-only stack, React over Vue,
  SSE over WebSockets, DOs for rate-limiting, Workers AI for
  personalisation, test boundaries (service stubs vs `cloudflare:test`
  pool-workers).
- `docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md` + `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md` + interactive
  `scripts/setup.sh` for 10-minute self-host on a clean account.
- README v1 (272 lines) with mermaid architecture diagram, 6 shields
  badges, dual quick-starts (React + embed), tech stack table.
- 1280×640 social-preview PNG + 12-second demo GIF generated via MCP
  Playwright.
- 5-scenario Playwright E2E smoke spec running against either local
  dev or live prod (`E2E_TARGET=prod`). 5/5 green vs production.

#### CI / Hygiene

- GitHub Actions workflow: lint, typecheck, test, gitleaks (with
  custom allowlist), Newman API contract tests (40 assertions across
  20 requests).
- Conventional Commits, MIT license, Code of Conduct (Contributor
  Covenant 2.1), Security disclosure policy, dependabot weekly bumps.
- `gitleaks.toml` configured to scan history; `pnpm` overrides pin
  patched versions for transitive `serialize-javascript`,
  `http-proxy-agent`, `ws`.

### Fixed

Four production bugs caught during first live demo→api traffic (all
hidden by mock-heavy unit tests):

- **`PollingClient` unbound `setInterval`/`clearInterval`** — storing
  the browser timer as a class property then calling it as a method
  invoked it with `this === PollingClient`, which the browser rejects
  with `TypeError: Illegal invocation`. Crashed the SSE→polling fallback
  path entirely.
- **`QuestKitClient` unbound `fetch`** — same root cause as above. All
  `authedFetch` calls (campaigns / missions / balance / recommendations)
  silently threw. Surfaced as "Couldn't load campaign" / "Couldn't load
  missions" alerts in the demo. Bound `fetch.bind(globalThis)` in the
  constructor.
- **`QuestKitClient.authedFetch` single-shot 401 retry** — defensive
  production-grade SDK pattern: if the first attempt's token is stale
  or empty (race on first mount, expired since cache, server rotated
  `JWT_SECRET`), refetch the token via `getToken()` and replay. Bubbles
  up only if the retry also 401s.
- **`questkit-worker-api` missing CORS middleware** — plan.md §5 specced
  "SDK runs on any host" but no `hono/cors` was ever wired. Added
  `app.use('*', cors({ origin: '*', allowMethods: GET/POST/OPTIONS,
allowHeaders: Content-Type/Authorization/Idempotency-Key, maxAge:
86400, credentials: false }))`.

Plus:

- `MissionCard` now renders `mission.iconUrl` as a 32×32 decorative
  `<img>` (`alt=""` + `aria-hidden="true"`, `loading="lazy"`,
  `decoding="async"`, explicit dims for CLS prevention).
- Docusaurus SSG unblocked via a three-layer fix: `null-loader` on
  `.css` + `client-modules.js`, `future.faster.swcJsLoader: true` +
  `@swc/core` devDep, removing `"type": "module"` from
  `apps/docs/package.json`. 36/36 routes render.
- `apps/docs/docusaurus.config.ts` migrated from top-level
  `onBrokenMarkdownLinks` to `markdown.hooks.onBrokenMarkdownLinks`
  (Docusaurus v4 forward-compat).
- Newman CI unblock chain (8 commits): bash prefires → bot-management
  bypass → Newman-native collection prefires → `pm.variables` scope
  fix → SSE folder removal. End state: 40/40 assertions pass.
- 3 dependabot vulnerabilities closed via `pnpm.overrides`:
  `serialize-javascript@^7.0.5` (HIGH RCE + MEDIUM DoS),
  `http-proxy-agent@^7.0.0` (drops `@tootallnate/once` LOW), and
  `ws@^8.20.1` (auto-dismissed MEDIUM memory disclosure).
- JWT signature-tamper test fix: flip the FIRST char of the base64url
  signature (fully-used 6-bit position) instead of the last (4 unused
  bits → intermittent CI flake when the unlucky path hits unused bits).

### Infrastructure

- Custom domains wired via `wrangler.jsonc` `routes[].custom_domain:
true`. CF auto-provisions DNS + SSL on first deploy. All 5 worker
  URLs return HTTPS 200.
- `APP_SECRET` rotation synchronised across api worker / demo worker /
  GitHub Actions secret `QUESTKIT_APP_SECRET`.
